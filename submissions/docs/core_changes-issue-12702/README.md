# prefers-reduced-motion Support

Adds comprehensive `prefers-reduced-motion` support to all EaseMotion animations.
When users enable "Reduce motion" in their OS/browser settings, all animations,
transitions, and hover effects are disabled to prevent discomfort for those with
vestibular motion disorders. Meets WCAG Success Criterion 2.3.3.

## Features

- **Universal suppression** — `*` selector targets all elements (not just ease-*)
- **Transitions disabled** — `transition-duration: 0.01ms` stops all CSS transitions
- **Scroll-behavior forced to `auto`** — no smooth scrolling
- **Hover effects disabled** — all `ease-hover-*` transformations suppressed
- **Looping animations stop** — `--ease-animation-iterations` defaults to `1` instead of `infinite`
- **Scroll reveal resolves immediately** — `.ease-reveal` elements appear without animation
- **`.ease-motion-safe` opt-in class** — elements can still animate when essential
- **Live toggle demo** — simulate reduced-motion in the browser

## Affected Core Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `core/variables.css` | Add `--ease-animation-iterations: 1` in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` |
| `core/animations.css` | Enhanced reduced-motion block with `*`, `transition-duration`, `scroll-behavior`, `.ease-motion-safe` |
| `core/reveal.js` | Already handles reduced motion (no change needed) |

## Usage

```css
/* Import after EaseMotion core */
@import "path/to/reduced-motion.css";

/* Essential animation — always plays */
<div class="ease-motion-safe ease-bounce">Essential</div>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default | Reduced Motion |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `--ease-animation-iterations` | `infinite` | `1` |
| `--ease-motion-safe-duration` | `300ms` | `300ms` (unaffected) |
| `--ease-motion-safe-iterations` | `infinite` | `infinite` (unaffected) |
