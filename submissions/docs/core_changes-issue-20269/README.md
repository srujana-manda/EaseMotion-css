# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20269

## Feature Overview
Issue #20269 requests a **Smart Manufacturing Operations Center** showcase example demonstrating EaseMotion CSS capabilities for industrial IoT and manufacturing dashboards.

The showcase features a double-sidebar layout with 6 core sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Production Monitoring** | Real-time line metrics, throughput, cycle time, and shift targets |
| **Quality Control** | Defect rate, pass/fail stats, and inspection results |
| **Predictive Maintenance** | Equipment health scores, remaining useful life, maintenance alerts |
| **OEE Tracking** | Overall Equipment Effectiveness with Availability, Performance, Quality breakdown |
| **Supply Chain Integration** | Inventory levels, supplier status, logistics pipeline |
| **Waste Reduction** | Scrap rate, energy consumption, sustainability metrics |

## Design Approach
- **Double-sidebar layout**: Left sidebar for plant navigation + shift info, right sidebar for alerts and KPIs
- **Industrial theme** with cyan/teal accent colors, machinery-style indicators
- **Staggered entrance animations** using `--i` custom property delays
- **Glassmorphism cards** with `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Animated progress gauges** for OEE and equipment health
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` respected
- Zero JavaScript, pure CSS

## Why this is submitted here
Per CONTRIBUTING.md policy and Core Framework Protection, this feature is proposed as a formal submission in `submissions/` rather than modifying `core/` or `components/` directly.

Fixes #20269
