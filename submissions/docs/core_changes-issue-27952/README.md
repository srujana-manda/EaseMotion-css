# ease-hover-lift — Hover Ripple Lift Animation

## What does this do?

Combines a subtle upward lift with a center-expanding ripple on hover. Pure CSS — no JS required. Uses `::before` pseudo-element for the ripple and `transform` for the lift.

## How is it used?

```html
<button class="ease-hover-lift">Click me</button>
<a class="ease-hover-lift" href="#">Link</a>
<div class="ease-hover-lift">Any element</div>
```

### Classes

|---|---|
| `.ease-hover-lift` | Lift + ripple on hover |
| `.ease-hover-lift-light` | Light ripple (for dark surfaces) |
| `.ease-hover-lift-dark` | Dark ripple (for light surfaces) |
