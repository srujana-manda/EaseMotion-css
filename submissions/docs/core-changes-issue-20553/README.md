# Mouse Parallax Background

## Overview

This submission demonstrates a smooth mouse parallax background effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Multiple background layers move at different speeds opposite to the cursor, creating a subtle depth effect.

## Features

* Three independent parallax layers.
* Adjustable parallax strength using a slider.
* Reset button to restore the default position.
* Smooth CSS transitions.
* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
* Uses CSS custom properties:

  * `--ease-mouse-x`
  * `--ease-mouse-y`

## File Structure

```
demo.html
style.css
README.md
```

## How It Works

1. JavaScript listens for mouse movement.
2. Cursor coordinates are converted into X and Y offsets.
3. The offsets are stored in CSS variables.
4. Each background layer uses a different translation multiplier to create a depth effect.
5. The slider allows the user to adjust the movement intensity.
6. The reset button returns all layers to their default position.

## Browser Support

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari (modern versions)

## Customization

You can:

* Change the gradient colors.
* Add more parallax layers.
* Modify the slider range.
* Adjust transition timing.
* Change the movement multipliers for stronger or subtler effects.
