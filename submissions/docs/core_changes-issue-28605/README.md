# ease-accordion — CSS-Only Accordion Component

## What does this do?

Provides an accordion/collapse component built purely with CSS using the native `<details>`/`<summary>` HTML elements. No JavaScript required. Supports single and exclusive (accordion) modes, smooth open/close animation, and custom icon indicators.

## How is it used?

```html
<div class="ease-accordion">
  <details class="ease-accordion-item" open>
    <summary class="ease-accordion-header">Section 1</summary>
    <div class="ease-accordion-content">
      <p>Content for section 1.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details class="ease-accordion-item">
    <summary class="ease-accordion-header">Section 2</summary>
    <div class="ease-accordion-content">
      <p>Content for section 2.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>
```

For exclusive mode (only one open at a time), use `<details name="accordion">`:

```html
<div class="ease-accordion">
  <details name="accordion-x" class="ease-accordion-item">
    <summary>...</summary>
    <div class="ease-accordion-content">...</div>
  </details>
  <details name="accordion-x" class="ease-accordion-item">
    <summary>...</summary>
    <div class="ease-accordion-content">...</div>
  </details>
</div>
```

### Variants

| Modifier | Effect |
|---|---|
| (none) | Default accordion with `+`/`×` icon |
| `.ease-accordion-chevron` | Chevron `▾`/`▴` icon instead of plus |
| `.ease-accordion-bordered` | Bordered items with rounded corners |
| `.ease-accordion-flush` | No borders, minimal style |

## CSS Custom Properties

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--ease-accordion-transition` | `300ms` | Open/close animation duration |
