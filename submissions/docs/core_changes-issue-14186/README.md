# Animated Search / Expand Input — Issue #14186

## What does this do?
A CSS-only animated search input with expand-on-focus behavior. The input collapses to a 40px circle by default and smoothly expands to 280px when focused, revealing the placeholder text and a fully faded-in search icon.

## How is it used?
```html
<div class="ease-search-wrapper">
  <svg class="ease-search-icon"><!-- search icon --></svg>
  <input class="ease-search-input" type="text" placeholder="Search...">
</div>
```

## Classes
| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `.ease-search-wrapper` | Container; controls width via `--ease-search-collapsed` / `--ease-search-expanded` |
| `.ease-search-input` | The text input; inherits width, border-radius 20px |
| `.ease-search-icon` | SVG icon; positioned absolutely, fades on wrapper focus |
| `.ease-search-wrapper-sm` | Small variant: 34px / 220px |
| `.ease-search-wrapper-lg` | Large variant: 48px / 340px |

## CSS Custom Properties
| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--ease-speed-medium` | 300ms | Transition duration for width, icon opacity, border |
| `--ease-ease-out` | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) | Easing function |
| `--ease-search-collapsed` | 40px | Width when unfocused |
| `--ease-search-expanded` | 280px | Width when focused |

## Why is it useful for EaseMotion CSS?
Animated search inputs are a common UI pattern (navbars, header toolbars). This provides a drop-in component with accessible focus handling, dark mode, and size variants.
