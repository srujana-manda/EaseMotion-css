# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20265

## Feature Overview
Issue #20265 requests a **Construction Project Intelligence Hub** showcase example demonstrating EaseMotion CSS for construction and civil engineering project management.

The showcase features a double-sidebar layout with 6 core sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project Progress** | Milestone tracking, phase completion, Gantt-style timeline bars |
| **Resource Allocation** | Crew utilization, equipment allocation, material requisitions |
| **Safety Monitoring** | Incident tracking, safety score, inspection status, hazard alerts |
| **Budget Analytics** | Budget vs. actual, cost breakdown, burn rate, variance analysis |
| **Material Management** | Inventory levels, reorder points, supplier status, delivery tracking |
| **Timeline Intelligence** | Schedule adherence, delay analysis, critical path, weather impact |

## Design Approach
- **Double-sidebar layout**: Left sidebar for project nav, right sidebar for alerts and KPIs
- **Construction theme** with orange/amber accent colors, concrete-inspired backgrounds
- **Staggered entrance animations** using `--i` custom property delays
- **Glassmorphism cards** with `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Animated progress bars** for completion tracking and budget spend
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` respected
- Zero JavaScript, pure CSS

## Why this is submitted here
Per CONTRIBUTING.md policy and Core Framework Protection, this feature is proposed as a formal submission in `submissions/` rather than modifying `core/` or `components/` directly.

Fixes #20265
