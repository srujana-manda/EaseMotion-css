# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20267

## Feature Overview
Issue #20267 requests a **Quantum Computing Operations Dashboard** showcase example demonstrating EaseMotion CSS capabilities for cutting-edge quantum computing interfaces.

The showcase features a double-sidebar layout with 6 core sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Qubit Monitoring** | Real-time qubit states, coherence times, gate fidelities |
| **Error Correction Analytics** | Error syndromes, correction cycles, logical error rates |
| **Circuit Performance** | Circuit depth, gate counts, execution times, throughput |
| **Research Metrics** | Publication output, citation tracking, experiment logs |
| **System Calibration** | Calibration status, drift metrics, auto-tuning progress |
| **Quantum Advantage Tracking** | Speedup ratios, problem benchmarks, milestone progress |

## Design Approach
- **Double-sidebar layout**: Left sidebar for system nav, right sidebar for quantum metrics
- **Futuristic quantum theme** with purple/violet/cyan neon accents
- **Staggered entrance animations** using `--i` custom property delays
- **Glassmorphism cards** with `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Pulse/glow animations** on qubit states and active experiments
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` respected
- Zero JavaScript, pure CSS

## Why this is submitted here
Per CONTRIBUTING.md policy and Core Framework Protection, this feature is proposed as a formal submission in `submissions/` rather than modifying `core/` or `components/` directly.

Fixes #20267
