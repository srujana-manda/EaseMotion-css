# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20419

## Feature Overview
An animated **Cybersecurity Threat Monitoring Dashboard** showcasing EaseMotion CSS capabilities in a SOC (Security Operations Center) context. The dashboard visualizes threat detection, firewall status, active alerts, network traffic, vulnerability scans, system health, and incident timelines — all with pure CSS animations, zero JavaScript.

## Dashboard Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Threat Level & Risk Overview** | Animated threat level indicator (Low/Critical) and system security posture stats |
| **Firewall Status** | Active firewall with allowed/blocked traffic counters and real-time connection states |
| **Active Alerts** | Severity-coded alert cards (Critical, Warning, Info) with animated glow indicators |
| **Network Traffic** | Visual traffic bars with animated packets, inbound/outbound metrics |
| **Vulnerability Scan** | Latest scan results with severity breakdown, progress bars, and finding counts |
| **Incident Timeline** | Recent security events with severity badges, timestamps, and hover details |

## Design Approach
- Dark cyber theme (`#0a0e1a` background, `#00ff88` accent green, color-coded severity levels)
- Glassmorphism cards with `backdrop-filter: blur()` and subtle border glows
- Staggered entrance animations using CSS custom property `--i` delays
- Pulse animations on critical alerts and threat indicators
- Animated bar charts and network traffic visualization
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` respected for accessibility
- Fully responsive: 3-column grid → 2 columns at 900px → 1 column at 600px
- Zero JavaScript, purely CSS-driven

## Why this is submitted here
Per CONTRIBUTING.md policy, all feature proposals must be submitted under `submissions/` rather than modifying `core/`, `components/`, or `docs/` directly. This submission follows that policy.
