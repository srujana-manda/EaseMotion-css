# CODEOWNERS Review Requirements Proposal

## Overview

This submission proposes a review workflow for protecting the framework's critical source directories by requiring maintainer approval for pull requests that modify them.

The proposal follows the repository's curated contribution model, where contributors submit feature proposals inside the `submissions/` directory while maintainers review, integrate, and merge approved changes into the framework.

---

## Problem Statement

The `core/` and `components/` directories contain the foundation of the EaseMotion CSS framework. Unauthorized or accidental modifications to these directories can introduce inconsistencies, regressions, or breaking changes that affect the entire project.

A CODEOWNERS-based review process ensures that all changes to these protected directories receive mandatory maintainer approval before they are merged.

---

## Proposed Solution

This proposal recommends the following workflow:

* Protect the `core/` directory using GitHub CODEOWNERS.
* Protect the `components/` directory using GitHub CODEOWNERS.
* Enable branch protection rules requiring CODEOWNERS approval before merging.
* Document the review policy in the project's contribution guidelines.
* Validate that pull requests affecting protected directories cannot be merged without maintainer approval.

---

## Example CODEOWNERS Configuration

```text
# Protected framework directories

core/*         @maintainer
components/*   @maintainer
```

---

## Proposed Review Workflow

1. A contributor opens a Pull Request.
2. GitHub evaluates the files modified in the Pull Request.
3. If the Pull Request modifies files inside `core/` or `components/`:

   * GitHub automatically requests review from the designated CODEOWNERS.
   * Branch protection prevents the Pull Request from being merged until approval is received.
4. If the Pull Request does not affect protected directories, the standard review process continues.

---

## Contribution Policy (Proposed)

To maintain framework quality and consistency, contributors should avoid directly modifying protected framework directories.

Once implemented, the following policy is recommended:

* Changes affecting `core/` require CODEOWNERS approval.
* Changes affecting `components/` require CODEOWNERS approval.
* Contributors continue submitting proposals through the `submissions/` directory.
* Maintainers remain responsible for reviewing, integrating, and merging approved framework changes.

This proposal reflects the repository's existing curated contribution model.

---

## Testing Strategy

After implementation, the following validation steps are recommended:

1. Create a Pull Request modifying a file inside `core/`.
2. Verify that GitHub automatically requests review from the CODEOWNERS.
3. Confirm that branch protection prevents merging until the required approval is provided.
4. Repeat the same validation for a file inside `components/`.
5. Verify that Pull Requests affecting other directories continue to follow the normal review workflow.

---

## Benefits

* Protects critical framework source files.
* Ensures consistent code quality through mandatory maintainer review.
* Reduces the risk of accidental or unauthorized changes.
* Supports a scalable and maintainable contribution workflow.
* Reinforces the repository's curated contribution model.

## Scope of This Submission

This submission is a documentation and workflow proposal only.

In accordance with the repository's contribution guidelines, it **does not** modify:

* `.github/CODEOWNERS`
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Branch protection settings
* Framework source files inside `core/` or `components/`

These changes are intended to be reviewed and integrated by the project maintainers if the proposal is accepted.

---

## Conclusion

Implementing CODEOWNERS review requirements for critical framework directories strengthens the project's security, consistency, and maintainability. By enforcing mandatory maintainer approval for changes to `core/` and `components/`, EaseMotion CSS can continue to scale while preserving its curated development model.
