# ease-magnetic — Magnetic Hover Button Component

## What does this do?

Creates a button that subtly follows the cursor on hover — a "magnetic" pull effect. The button shifts toward the mouse position within a radius, then snaps back on leave. Requires minimal JS for cursor tracking.

## How is it used?

```html
<button class="ease-magnetic">
  Hover me
  <span class="ease-magnetic-inner">Label</span>
</button>
```
