# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20261

## Feature Overview

Issue [#20261](https://github.com/SAPTARSHI-coder/EaseMotion-css/issues/20261) requests a **Biotech Research Intelligence Platform** showcase example demonstrating EaseMotion CSS capabilities in an enterprise dashboard context.

This submission provides a complete, self-contained demo under `submissions/core_changes-issue-20261/`.

## Showcase Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Genomics Analytics | DNA sequence coverage, variant calling stats, gene expression heatmap |
| Lab Operations | Equipment status, sample tracking, active runs |
| Protein Analysis | Structure visualization mockup, folding metrics |
| Research Pipeline | Staged workflow progress tracker |
| Publication Tracking | Paper status board with review milestones |
| Grant Management | Funding overview, budget burn-down, deadlines |

## Design Approach

- **Dark glassmorphism theme** using `backdrop-filter: blur()` with EaseMotion CSS color tokens
- **Staggered entrance animations** combining `ease-slide-up`, `ease-fade-in`, and custom delays
- **Responsive grid layout** using CSS Grid with `auto-fill`/`auto-fit`
- **Micro-interactions** on hover for cards and stats
- **Zero JavaScript** — all interactivity via CSS `:hover`, transitions, and keyframe animations
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** respected throughout

## Why this is submitted here

Per the `CONTRIBUTING.md` policy and Core Framework Protection, this example is proposed as a formal submission in the `submissions/` directory rather than modifying core framework files directly.

Fixes #20261
