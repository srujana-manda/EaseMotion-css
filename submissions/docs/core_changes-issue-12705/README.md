# Interactive Playground

Adds an interactive live-editing playground to the EaseMotion CSS documentation site where users can experiment with EaseMotion classes in real-time.

## Features

- **Live HTML Editor**: Write HTML with EaseMotion classes in a textarea with syntax-friendly font and tab support
- **Live Preview**: An iframe that updates in real-time (300ms debounce) with the CDN stylesheet loaded
- **CSS Variable Controls**: Sliders and color pickers for `--ease-color-primary`, `--ease-speed-fast`, `--ease-speed-medium`, `--ease-speed-slow`
- **Class Browser**: Searchable list of all EaseMotion classes — click to insert at cursor position
- **Copy Button**: One-click copy of editor content to clipboard
- **Reset Button**: Restore the default example code
- **Resizable Panes**: Drag the divider between editor and preview
- **Persistence**: Code is saved to localStorage between sessions
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to refresh preview immediately
- **Responsive**: Layout collapses to single column on mobile
